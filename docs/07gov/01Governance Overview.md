### 社区治理目标Objectives of Governance
Neon governance is the process by which community stakeholders:  
Neon 治理是社区利益相关者参与以下事项的过程:  

- Reach consensus on solving issues that cannot be fully covered by software algorithms.  
   就解决软件算法无法完全覆盖的问题达成共识。  

- Develop rules for the functioning of governance in accordance with the decisions stakeholders make, and record and store rules within the blockchain.  
   根据利益相关者做出的决策制定治理运作规则，并在区块链中记录和存储规则。  

- Change the governance rules themselves through contractual amendments.
   通过合同修改来改变治理规则本身。  

Since the results depend on Neon stability, a high level of coordination must be ensured when making changes to the management and technical processes to ensure that any changes to Neon are secure and approved by the community. It is also necessary to make the process of resolving issues related to Neon management transparent.

由于结果取决于 Neon 的稳定性，因此管理和技术流程更改时必须确保高度协调，确保任何对 Neon 的更改都是安全且得到社区批准的。同时，必须让 Neon 管理相关的问题变得透明。

### 提交和评估提案 (Submitting and Evaluating Proposals)

Any Neon user can submit an idea, which is called a Neon improvement proposal. Each proposal is included in the list of promising solutions (use cases) and discussed on a forum. After a proposal is submitted, it goes through a formal life cycle of technical reviews, research, and discussions. The need for discussion allows management to exclude the implementation of inefficient or risky solutions in Neon.

任何 Neon 用户都可以提交一个想法，可称之为 Neon 改进提案。每个提案都被包含在名为“有希望的解决方案（用例）”的列表中，并会在论坛上进行讨论。提案提交后，将经历从技术审查到研究到讨论的正式生命周期。讨论需求将允许管理层排除在 Neon 中实施低效或有风险的解决方案。

Proposals can affect both the management and technical processes of Neon. If this is a proposal to change the logic of system contracts or to improve the technical capabilities of Neon, then this proposal must be tested on either Devnet or Testnet. Proposals for the implementation of new features associated with risk or high labor costs go through the following formal process:

提案可能会影响到 Neon 的管理和技术流程，如果这是改变系统合约逻辑或提高 Neon 技术能力的提案，那么这个提案必须在 Devnet 或 Testnet 上进行测试。与风险或高劳动力成本相关的新功能需要经过以下正式流程：

- Substantiation of the need to implement this proposal, taking into account its labor intensity and relevance.  
   在考虑到劳动强度和相关程度的情况下，证明实施该提案的必要性。

- Development of technical specifications for the implementation of this proposal.  
   制定实施本提案的技术规范。

- Appointment of a worker for the implementation of the proposal. The worker may be an individual, a group of individuals, or a third-party company.  
   指定实施提案的工作人员，工作人员可以是个人、团体或第三方公司。

- Verification and decision on acceptance of the work done.  
   对已完成工作的验收和决定。

Stakeholders make the final decision to change the logic of system contracts, to implement new functionality associated with risks or high costs, and can also take action against community members whose actions may harm the development of Neon.

利益相关者最终决定改变系统合约的逻辑，实施与风险或高成本相关的新功能，也可以对可能损害 Neon 发展的社区成员采取行动。

Stakeholders make all decisions through voting using the Neon Governance application. The status of current proposals and decisions on them are displayed on the main page of the _Neon Governance_ application.

利益相关者使用 _Neon社区治理 (Neon Governance)_ 应用，通过投票做出所有决策。当前提案和决策的状态显示在 _Neon社区治理应用 (Neon Governance application)_ 的主页上。

#### Neon 改进中的论坛功能  (Forum Features in the Neon Project Improvements)

The forum provides transparency, which is vital to the project because it increases the number of people who understand and can improve the project.

论坛提供了对项目至关重要透明度，它增加了了解并可以改进项目的人数。

The forum also increases the decentralization of the project, involving both Neon developers and third-party teams in the discussion of ideas. It allows everyone to express their opinion on a particular proposal.

论坛还增提升了项目的去中心化程度，让 Neon 开发者和第三方团队都参与讨论想法，让每个人都可以就特定提案发表意见。

However, the forum is not the place for：  
但是，论坛不适合：

- 一般讨论 (General discussion)
- 广告 (Advertising)
- 泛泛而谈 (Off-topic conversations)
- 政治 (Political discussions)

#### Neon 改进中的社区治理 UI 功能 (Governance UI Features in the Neon Project Improvements)

The purpose of Governance UI is to:  
社区治理 UI 主要是为了：

- Store proposals and their related votes in the network's state.  
   将提案及其相关投票存储在网络状态中。

- Increase the decentralization of governance through decision-making by majority vote.
   通过多数票决策增加治理的去中心化。

- Avoid imposing ideas or their implementations.  
   避免强制(让社区)接收想法或其实施。

- Eliminate the adoption of ambitious decisions, the implementation of which is associated with high risk.
   避免采用与高风险相关的过于激进的决策。
