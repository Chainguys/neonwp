title: 权益证明(Proof-of-Stake)
---


Ethereum is moving to a consensus mechanism called **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** from **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**.

以太坊共识机制正在从**工作量证明 (PoW)** 转向**权益证明 (PoS)** 。

#### 什么是权益证明(What is Proof-of-Stake?)

**PoS** is a method of cryptocurrency protection, in which the probability of forming the next block in the blockchain depends on the existing stake of the participant, and not on powerful equipment, as is the case with **PoW**.

PoS 是一种加密货币保护机制，其中在区块链中生成下一个区块的概率取决于参与者的现有权益，而不是像 PoW 那样取决于强大的设备。

#### PoS如何工作?(How does PoS work?)

The network itself verifies transactions. It also maintains anonymity and security, since the cryptocurrency is already distributed among the users of the network.

网络本身验证交易。它还要保持匿名性和安全性，因为加密货币已经分布在网络用户之间。

Unlike **PoW**, validators don't need to use significant amounts of computational power because they're selected at random and aren't competing. They don't need to mine blocks; they just need to create blocks when chosen and validate proposed blocks when they're not. This validation is known as attesting.

与 **PoW** 不同的是，验证者不需要使用大量的算力，因为它们是随机选择且没有竞争。他们不需要“挖矿”；他们只需要在被选中时创建区块，并在未被选中时验证提议的区块。这种验证称为证明。

#### PoS基础概念(The PoS concept)

- The **PoS** concept states that a person can mine or verify block transactions depending on how many coins he holds; this means that the more coins a miner owns, the more mining power he has.  
   PoS 概念是指一个人可以根据他持有多少个币来挖掘或验证区块交易；这意味着矿工拥有的代币越多，他的挖矿能力就越大。

- The probability of checking a new block is determined by how large the share that a person holds.  
   检查一个新区块的概率取决于一个人持有的份额有多大。

- Validators do not receive block rewards; instead, they take network commission as their reward.  
   验证者不获得区块奖励；相反，他们将网络佣金作为奖励。

- Unlike **PoW, PoS** systems can be more cost-effective and efficient, but less decentralized.  
   与 PoW 不同，PoS 系统可以更加划算更加有效率，但去中心化程度更低。
